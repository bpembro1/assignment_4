    <h1>These Are My 4 Cute Dogs</h1>
    <div> <h2>Cerberus or Cerby for short</h2>
    <a href="Cerby.jpg"><img src="pictures/Cerby.jpg" alt=" Cerby" height="400"></a>
    <p>Cerberus is a 3 legged stump, she is crazy but really cute! When we got her it was 2 weeks after she got surgery to amputate her leg but that doesn't stop her from running around and getting into trouble!</p> </div>
   <div> <h2>Dexter</h2>
    <a href="dexter.jpg"><img src="pictures/dexter.jpg" alt="Dexter" height="500"></a>
    <p> Dexter (top) was the first dog that we addopted. He is a momma's boy and is afraid of anything and everything!</p> </div>
    <div> <h2> Polka Dotty</h2>
    <a href="Dotty.jpg"><img src="pictures/Dotty.jpg" alt=" Polka Dotty" height="200"></a>
    <p> When we got Dotty she was rescued from a home where she was being used as a breading dog. She now has a much happier life with her furry siblings! Her favorite passtimes include: Going for walks, laying in mud, and sleeping her cares away!</p> </div>
   <div> <h2>Hercules</h2>
    <a href="Herc.jpg"><img src="pictures/Herc.jpg" alt="Herc" height="200"></a>
    <p> Hercules is the new puppy, he is a sweet little block head who doesnt look before he leaps! He loves everything all the time, especially meeting new people or dogs!</p> </div>
