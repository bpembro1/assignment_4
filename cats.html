    <p>Gilly is a super fluffy boy and all he wants is love constantly! i found him on the side of the road when he was 2 weeks old, he could barely open his eyes. We had to feed him through an eye dropper and give him medication for the first 2 weeks he was with us. </p>
    <h2>Lando</h2>

    <p> Landy is a cautious kitty he is the oldest pet in the house! He loves to cuddle and sit on your lap, but not picked up, but he is cautious of new people and takes awhile to warm up to you but once he warms up all he wants is attention</p>
